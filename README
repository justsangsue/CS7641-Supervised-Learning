To repeat the experiment, download the dataset first from kaggle:
Genetic Variant: https://www.kaggle.com/kevinarvai/clinvar-conflicting
Medical Charges: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance

Then run data processing:
"ClinvarDataProcessing.py" and "MedicalCostDataProcessing.py"

For each learning algorithm, run the following .py files to train and generate figures
DecisionTree.py
AdaBoost.py
kNN.py
SVM.py
NeuralNetworks.py
